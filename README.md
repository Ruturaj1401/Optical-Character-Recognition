# Optical-Character-Recognition
Optical Character Recognition using EasyOCR, Pytesseract and KerasOCR

# Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the usage of three popular OCR libraries: EasyOCR, KerasOCR, and Pytesseract. Optical Character Recognition is a technology that enables the recognition of text content in images or scanned documents, making it useful for a wide range of applications like document digitization, text extraction from images, and more.

# Features
Utilizes three powerful OCR libraries: EasyOCR, KerasOCR, and Pytesseract.
Recognizes text content from images and documents with varying complexities.
Allows easy comparison of the performance and accuracy of different OCR engines.
Supports multiple languages for text recognition.
